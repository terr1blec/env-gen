# FastMCP Server Database Integration Tests

This directory contains automated tests for validating the FastMCP server's integration with the offline database.

## Test Summary

### ✅ Test Results

**All tests passed successfully!**

### Test Coverage

1. **Database File Validation** ✅
   - Database JSON file exists and is accessible
   - Metadata JSON file exists and follows schema

2. **Schema Validation** ✅
   - Database has correct structure with required keys: `flights`, `offers`, `stays`, `reviews`
   - Metadata has required fields: `name`, `description`, `tools`
   - Each tool follows proper schema with input/output definitions

3. **Data Integrity** ✅
   - Database can be successfully loaded and parsed
   - Contains sufficient data for meaningful operations (50+ flights, 100+ offers, 30+ stays, 200+ reviews)
   - Data consistency: offers reference valid flights, reviews reference valid stays

4. **Server Capability Alignment** ✅
   - Metadata tools align with server capabilities
   - Tools include: `search_flights`, `search_stays`, `get_offer_details`, `get_stay_reviews`, `search_multi_city`

### Database Statistics

- **Flights**: 50 flight records with detailed segments
- **Offers**: 100+ flight offers with pricing and details
- **Stays**: 30 accommodation options in various locations
- **Reviews**: 200+ stay reviews with ratings and comments

### Key Findings

- ✅ Database structure is valid and consistent
- ✅ Metadata properly describes server capabilities
- ✅ Sufficient data exists for all advertised tools
- ✅ Data relationships are maintained (offers → flights, reviews → stays)
- ✅ Server module exists and is properly structured

### Test Files

- `test_server_database.py` - Core database and metadata validation
- `test_server_integration.py` - Integration tests and data operations

### Running Tests
