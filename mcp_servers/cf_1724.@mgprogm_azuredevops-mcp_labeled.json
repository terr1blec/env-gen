    "analysis": "The Azure DevOps Integration Server focuses on providing access and management capabilities for Microsoft's Azure DevOps platform through an MCP interface. It allows users to track work items, manage repositories, plan sprints, conduct tests, perform security scans, and handle artifacts. The server also enables AI-assisted development operations, suggesting a strong automation component. The core functionality revolves around software development lifecycle management and Azure platform integration.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label is chosen due to the server's core functionality centered around development operations, workflow automation, and code management, all of which are fundamental in a development workflow. The secondary labels are selected because the server involves interaction with code repositories (Database Operations, though this could also be considered version control) and the use of AI for development tasks (AI/ML Tools). No custom label is needed as the predefined categories adequately cover its functionality.",
