    "analysis": "The MCP Server described is designed to enhance integration with Home Assistant, a popular smart home automation platform. Its core functionality revolves around controlling, monitoring, and managing various aspects of a smart home environment. The available tools allow users to interact with Home Assistant's API to fetch entity states, list entities, and presumably control them (as suggested by the overall description). This server solves the problem of providing a seamless, AI-assisted interface for smart home management.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Operating System\" is chosen because the server primarily interacts with a home automation system's underlying entities and functionalities, similar to how one would manage device states and operations through an OS. \"API Integration\" is a secondary label because the tools directly interact with the Home Assistant API, and \"Daily Productivity\" is included as it may enhance day-to-day smart home management. No custom label is needed as the predefined labels adequately cover the server's purpose.",
