    "analysis": "The MCP Server functions primarily as a remote shell execution environment, allowing users to run shell commands on a remote system securely. It supports configurable options like custom working directories and timeouts, and integrates with MCP-compatible clients via streaming or standard I/O transports. The primary use case revolves around executing remote shell commands, which aligns with system management and remote command execution.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Operating System\" is chosen because the server's core functionality involves managing and executing shell commands on a remote system, which is a fundamental aspect of operating system operations. The secondary label \"Security & Authentication\" is included due to the server's emphasis on secure remote session management. No custom label is needed as the predefined labels sufficiently cover the server's functionality.",
