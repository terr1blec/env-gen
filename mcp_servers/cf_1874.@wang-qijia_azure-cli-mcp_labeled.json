    "analysis": "The MCP Server is designed to provide an interface for managing Azure resources using the Azure CLI through natural language commands. It enables users to automate tasks related to Azure resource management, such as listing resources, fixing configurations, and creating services. The core functionality revolves around executing Azure CLI commands in a conversational manner, making it easier to integrate Azure operations into development workflows or chat-based environments.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Cloud Services\" is chosen because the server focuses on managing Azure resources, which is a cloud platform. The secondary label \"Development Tools\" is selected because the server enhances productivity for developers by providing a conversational interface to Azure CLI, which is commonly used in development environments. The secondary label \"Operating System\" is included because the Azure CLI often interacts with system-level operations.",
