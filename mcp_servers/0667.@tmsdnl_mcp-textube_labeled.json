    "analysis": "The MCP Server \"Textube\" specializes in extracting, analyzing, and summarizing content from YouTube video transcripts. Its tools, \"deep_analyze\" and \"quick_summarize,\" focus on breaking down video content to identify key insights, verify facts, and present structured summaries. The server cater to users who need fast access to video information without watching the entire content, making it ideal for research, content creation, and knowledge extraction.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Content Creation\" was chosen because Textube facilitates the creation of transcript-based summaries and analysis, which is a form of content generation. \"Web Search & Research\" is a secondary label since the tool helps users quickly gather and process information from online video content. The custom label \"Video Analysis\" was added to specifically describe its niche functionality of analyzing video transcripts.",
