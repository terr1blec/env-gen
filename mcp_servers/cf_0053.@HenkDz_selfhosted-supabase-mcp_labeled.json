    "analysis": "The MCP Server is specifically designed to interact with self-hosted Supabase instances, allowing developers to manage core Supabase features such as database schemas, migrations, authentication, storage, and realtime functionality directly from their development environment. It streamlines project management for Supabase projects by providing a minimal, focused interface tailored for self-hosted setups. The available tools indicate a primary focus on database and authentication management, which are central to Supabase's offerings.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label is chosen because the server's core functionality revolves around managing and interacting with a database (Supabase's PostgreSQL instance). Secondary labels are added because the server also deals with user authentication and realtime data handling, which are key features of Supabase. The custom label is added to highlight the unique focus on self-hosted environments, which isn't fully captured by the predefined categories.",
