    "analysis": "The MCP Server is designed to facilitate code review and analysis using AI-powered tools. Its primary functionality involves examining codebases for quality, security, performance, and maintainability issues. The available tools focus on repository analysis and comprehensive, actionable code reviews, making it particularly useful for developers, development teams, and organizations that prioritize code quality and best practices.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Development Tools\" was chosen because the server's core functionality directly supports software development through code analysis and review. Secondary labels like \"Code Quality & Best Practices\" and \"AI/ML Tools\" were selected because the server leverages AI to provide insights into code quality and adheres to best practices in the development workflow. While the predefined categories don't perfectly capture all nuances, they provide the closest match to the server's purposes.",
