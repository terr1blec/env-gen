    "analysis": "The Linear MCP Server is designed to interact with Linear, a project management tool. Its core functionality revolves around searching, creating, and managing issues and projects within Linear directly from other applications. The available tool, \"linear-search-issues,\" suggests that the server focuses on querying and retrieving issue-related data from Linear, simplifying project management and issue tracking workflows.",
    "reasoning": "The primary functionality of the Linear MCP Server is directly tied to project management, particularly issue tracking and issue searching. Therefore, the \"Project Management\" label is most fitting. Since the server integrates with Linear to enhance workflows, \"API Integration\" is a relevant secondary label as it enables seamless interaction with Linear's API. No custom label is needed as the predefined labels adequately cover the server's functionality.",
