    "analysis": "The MCP VirusTotal Server is primarily designed for security analysis and threat intelligence. It provides access to VirusTotal's API, enabling comprehensive analysis of URLs, files, IP addresses, and domains. The server offers detailed reports and relationship queries that uncover malicious activities, file behaviors, network connections, and threat actor associations. It serves as a powerful tool for cybersecurity investigations, threat tracking, and security research.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Security & Authentication\" was chosen because the server's core functionality revolves around threat analysis and security reporting. The secondary label \"API Integration\" is relevant due to its VirusTotal API-based operation. No custom label is needed as the predefined categories sufficiently cover the server's purpose.",
