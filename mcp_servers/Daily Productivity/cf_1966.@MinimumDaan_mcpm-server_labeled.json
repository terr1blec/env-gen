Focus specifically on \"write\" tools - those that create, modify, or send content: - CREATE tools: Generate documents, tickets, media, or other resources - SEND tools: Post messages to channels or notify stakeholders - MODIFY tools: Update existing data, change settings, or edit content - SCHEDULE tools: Set up automations or future actions - ADD tools: Contribute information to existing systems This tool employs a structured multi-step thinking process: 1. Context Analysis: Examines task requirements, research data, and project needs 2. Iterative Refinement: Builds and refines suggestions through sequential thinking 3. Impact Assessment: Evaluates each suggestion for relevance, effectiveness, and feasibility 4. Finalization: Prepares well-formed, actionable suggestions ready for implementation 5. Storage: Persists suggestions in the database for PM review and execution REQUIRED FIELDS FOR EACH SUGGESTION: 1. mcpServerName: The platform or service name (e.g., \"Slack\", \"Loom\", \"Figjam\") - This identifies where the action will be performed - Must match one of the available configured tools 2. toolName: The specific function to call (e.g., \"slack_post_message\", \"getLoomTranscript\") - Each tool has specific functions with unique capabilities - Use the exact function name as defined in the tool's API 3. toolInput: JSON string containing all parameters required by the function - Must be valid JSON format - Include all required parameters for the specified function - Must be the actual parameters for the function, not a description of what to do - Always make sure give the actual input of the tool/function, if you're suggesting a tool that creates something, make sure to give the actual input for the tool. If you're suggesting a tool that sends a message, make sure to give the actual message to send. - Example: \"{\\\"channel_id\\\":\\\"C0123456789\\\",\\\"text\\\":\\\"Hey team, here's a new wireframe for the new feature request\\\"}\" 4. reasoning: Clear explanation of why this action is valuable - Connect to specific project goals or requirements - Explain the expected outcome and benefit 5. priority & estimatedImpact: Help prioritize execution - Both fields accept \"high\", \"medium\", or \"low\" values - Used to sort and prioritize the execution of suggestions Example Suggestion: \"mcpServerName\": \"Slack\", \"toolName\": \"slack_post_message\", \"toolInput\": \"{\\\"channel_id\\\":\\\"C0123456789\\\",\\\"text\\\":\\\"Hey team, here's a new wireframe for the new feature request\\\"}\", \"reasoning\": \"The design team needs to be notified about the new wireframe requirements\", \"priority\": \"high\", \"estimatedImpact\": \"medium\" WORKFLOW FOR USING THIS TOOL: 1. Initialize with your taskId and relevant context 2. Process iteratively through a series of thoughts, building a coherent set of suggestions 3. Each thought should evaluate current suggestions and identify potential new ones 4. When your suggestions are complete and well-formed, set shouldFinalize to true 5. The system will validate, store, and prepare your suggestions for PM review RESEARCH INTEGRATION GUIDELINES: Research phases dictate when to generate suggestions: - initializing: Too early for action suggestions - researching: Focus on research-enhancing suggestions only - analyzing: Begin suggesting preliminary actions based on early findings - completed: Provide comprehensive action suggestions based on complete research Only suggest final actions when research is in the 'completed' phase.",
