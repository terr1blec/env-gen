    "analysis": "The MCP Server provides integration with Todoist, a popular task management and productivity application. It offers extensive functionality to create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks, projects, and sections within Todoist. The server also supports task filtering through advanced query syntax, label management, collaborative features, and productivity statistics. Essentially, it enables users to interact with their Todoist workspace programmatically via an LLM, enhancing productivity and task management capabilities.",
    "reasoning": "The primary functionality of this server revolves around task and project management within the Todoist ecosystem. Therefore, \"Daily Productivity\" is the most fitting primary label, as the tools focus heavily on organizing tasks, setting deadlines, tracking progress, and improving workflow efficiency. Secondary labels like \"File Management\" (for task/project structure) and \"Database Operations\" (for querying tasks) complement but are not as central. The server's unique integration with Todoist warrants no custom labels, as the predefined categories adequately cover its use cases.",

          "description": "Get all tasks from Todoist using a filter. Filters are custom views for your tasks based on specific criteria. You can narrow down your lists according to task name, date, project, label, priority, date created, and more. There are a range of symbols you can use to filter the tasks. For example, 'today' will get all tasks due today. Here’s a rundown of some of the more advanced filters you can use in Todoist: In order to create filters based on keywords, you can use `search`: followed by a keyword. - See all tasks that contain the word \"Meeting\", use this: \"search: Meeting\" - See all tasks that contain the word \"Meeting\" that are due today, use this: \"search: Meeting & today\" - See all tasks that contain either the word \"Meeting\" or \"Work\", use this: \"search: Meeting | search: Work\" - See all tasks that contain the word \"email\", use this: \"search: email\" - See all tasks that contain web links, use this: \"search: http\" Create a filter to either see or exclude sub-tasks in the view: - See all sub-tasks, use this: \"subtask\" - See all parent tasks while excluding their sub-tasks, use this: \"!subtask\" See all tasks scheduled for a specific date: - View all tasks scheduled for January 3rd, use this: \"date: Jan 3\" - See all tasks dated before a specific date, use this: \"date before: May 5\" or \"date before: 5/5\" - See all tasks dated after a specific date, use this: \"date after: May 5\" or \"date after: 5/5\" - See all tasks scheduled within the next four hours and all overdue tasks, use this: \"date before: +4 hours\" - See all tasks dated in the current working week, use this: \"date before: sat\" - See all tasks that are dated for next week, use this: \"(date: next week | date after: next week) & date before: 1 week after next week\" - See all tasks dated within the current calendar month, use this: \"date before: first day\" - See active tasks dated yesterday, along with today's tasks listed below, use this: \"date: yesterday, today\" - See all tasks that have no date associated with them, use this: \"no date\" - See all tasks with a date assigned to them, use this: \"!no date\" - See all tasks with a date and time assigned to them, use this: \"!no date & !no time\" - See all tasks dated today and before a specific time, use this: \"date: today & date before: today at 2pm\" - See all tasks that are overdue, use this: \"Overdue\" or \"over due\" or \"od\" - See all tasks that are overdue and have had time assigned to them, along with all tasks dated today and with time assigned to them, use this: \"overdue & !no time, date: today & !no time\" - See all tasks in your Inbox without a date, followed by a separate section with all your tasks that have dates set, but are not in your Inbox: \"#Inbox & no due date, All & !#Inbox & !no due date\" You can write a date in any of these ways: - Specific date: 10/5/2022, Oct 5th 2022 - Specific date and time: 10/5/2022 5pm, Oct 5th 5pm - Relative date: today, tomorrow, yesterday, 3 days (dated in the next 3 days), -3 days (dated in the past 3 days) - Days of the week: Monday, Tuesday, Sunday Examples with deadlines: - See all tasks with no deadlines, use this: \"no deadline\" - See all tasks with a deadline, use this: \"!no deadline\" - See all tasks with a deadline today, use this: \"deadline: today\" - See all tasks with a deadline within the next 7 days: \"deadline after: yesterday & deadline before: in 7 days\" - See all tasks with overdue deadlines: \"deadline before: today\" Due takes into consideration the date and deadline fields. If a task has both, a date and deadline, due prioritizes the date. If the task does not have a date, due will check if the deadline matches filter criteria. If you don't use deadlines, due and date filters will return the same results. - View all tasks due on January 3rd: \"Jan 3\" - See all tasks that are due before a specific date, use this: \"due before: May 5\" or \"due before: 5/5\" - See all tasks that are due after a specific date, use this: \"due after: May 5\" or \"due after: 5/5\" - See all tasks due within the next four hours and all overdue tasks, use this: \"due before: +4 hours\" - See all tasks that are due before the day you've selected in Settings > General > Next week, use this: \"due before: next week\" - See all tasks due in the current working week, use this: \"due before: sat\" -
