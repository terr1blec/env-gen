    "analysis": "The PaperMCP Academic Paper Search Server is designed to facilitate academic research by providing sophisticated search capabilities for academic papers. It allows users to filter and sort search results by various criteria such as keywords, country, publication year, open access status, and citation count or relevance. The server integrates with MCP-compatible clients to enhance research efficiency. The core functionality revolves around web-based research and information retrieval within an academic context.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Web Search & Research\" is selected because the server's main purpose is to enable efficient academic paper searches, which aligns with web-based research and information gathering. The secondary label \"Database Operations\" is appropriate due to the server's ability to filter and sort search results, implying some level of database interaction. While the server could also relate to \"Communication Tools\" for knowledge sharing, it is less central to its core functionality.",
