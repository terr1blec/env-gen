    "analysis": "The MCP Server described is primarily focused on project management and file operations within a controlled development environment. Its core functionality includes exploring project structures, managing files and directories, searching through code/files with advanced filtering, and checking for outdated dependencies. The tools provided enable secure file handling within allowed directories while enhancing developer productivity through intelligent project insights and dependency management.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Development Tools\" was chosen because the server's tools are directly aimed at assisting developers in project management, file operations, and dependency checkingâ€”core activities in software development. The secondary label \"File Management\" was selected due to the server's extensive capabilities for file searching, renaming, and deleting within allowed directories. The \"Database Operations\" label is included because advanced file searching with filtering resembles database querying operations. No custom label is needed as the predefined categories adequately cover the server's functionality.",
