    "analysis": "The MCP Server is primarily designed to facilitate interactions with Perplexity AI, a tool that provides expert programming assistance. The available tools enable users to create new conversations, continue existing ones, list all chats, and retrieve full conversation histories. This server solves problems related to coding assistance, error debugging, and maintaining context in programming-related discussions.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Development Tools\" was chosen because the server's core functionality revolves around providing programming assistance, including coding solutions and error debugging. The secondary label \"AI/ML Tools\" is relevant as the server interacts with an AI model (Perplexity AI) to deliver its services. No custom label is necessary as the predefined categories adequately cover the server's functionality.",
