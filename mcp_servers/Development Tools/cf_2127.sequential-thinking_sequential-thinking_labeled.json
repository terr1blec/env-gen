    "analysis": "The MCP Server focuses on enhancing problem-solving by breaking down complex problems into sequential steps. Its primary function appears to be aiding users in structured thinking through a step-by-step approach, with tools to summarize the thought process and reset the workflow. This suggests it is primarily a tool for cognitive processing and organizing thinking patterns.",
    "reasoning": "The \"Development Tools\" label is chosen because the server's sequential thinking and problem breakdown are valuable for developers and users involved in thoughtful, structured processes, such as debugging or algorithm design. The \"Daily Productivity\" label is appropriate as it aids in organized thinking, which is essential for productivity. The \"AI/ML Tools\" label is added because the structured thinking process could be leveraged for AI/ML model interaction or training.",
