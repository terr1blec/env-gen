    "analysis": "The Taskeract Server is designed to enhance productivity for developers by integrating task management directly into their code editor environment. It provides tools to retrieve project tasks, manage task statuses, and maintain synchronization between the integrated development environment (IDE) and task workflows. The core functionality revolves around task tracking, status management, and stakeholder requirement integration within the development workflow.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Development Tools\" was chosen because the server directly supports development workflows by managing tasks within the IDE. The secondary label \"Daily Productivity\" was selected because the tool enhances efficiency in developer task management. The secondary label \"Database Operations\" is considered relevant due to the tasks likely being managed in a database backend. No custom label is needed as the predefined categories adequately cover the server's functionality.",
