    "analysis": "The MCP Delayed Counter Service is designed to provide a simple mechanism for counting with a configurable delay, enabling asynchronous operations and stateful counting. This service appears to be a utility for demonstrating or implementing delayed/scheduled counting functionality in applications, making it useful for anything requiring timed operations. The available tool suggests it's deployable and can be tested in a playground environment.",
    "reasoning": "The primary functionality revolves around timing and counting, which aligns most closely with **Development Tools** as it aids in demonstration, testing, and integration of delayed operations in applications. The need for scheduling and configurable delays also relates to **Time & Calendar** functionality. There is no strong need for a custom label as the predefined categories sufficiently cover the core use cases.",
