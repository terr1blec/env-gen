    "analysis": "The MCP Server is specialized for managing and automating configurations of F5 Network devices, particularly through the iControl REST API. Its core functionality involves creating, updating, listing, and deleting objects such as virtual servers, pools, iRules, and profiles on F5 devices. The tools provided enable detailed interaction with F5's device management capabilities, making it suitable for network administrators and DevOps teams who need to programmatically manage their F5 infrastructure.",
    "reasoning": "The primary functionality aligns closely with network device management and automation, particularly with F5 devices. While it involves API integration and automation, it is more specifically focused on F5 device operations rather than general automation or API tasks. Thus, the primary label \"Network Device Management\" is most appropriate. Secondary labels such as \"API Integration\" and \"Automation Tools\" complement this by highlighting the technical methods used to achieve the device management goals.",
