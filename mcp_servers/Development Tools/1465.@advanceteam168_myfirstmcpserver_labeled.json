    "analysis": "The MCP Server described is a containerized Python server designed to facilitate integration with MCP clients. Its main purpose appears to be providing a simple framework for exposing tools, resources, and prompts in a modular, easily deployable manner using Docker. The example tool included suggests it is intended as a foundational platform for building specific functionality around it. The core problem it solves is enabling developers to quickly set up and deploy server-side components for MCP-based applications with minimal configuration.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Development Tools\" was chosen because the server is fundamentally a development platform meant to streamline deployment and integration of MCP components. While it could be used for specific domains (like \"Browser Automation\" if example_tool were related to that), its base functionality aligns more with development tooling. No additional predefined labels are clearly applicable at this abstract level, and the custom label \"MCP Development Framework\" captures its specific purpose within the larger toolchain.",
