    "analysis": "The MCP Server provides functionality to query the latest commit information for any file in the Chromium repository. It fetches detailed commit data including hash, author, timestamp, message, modified files, and diffs. This allows users to programmatically access and automate the retrieval of version control information. The server supports multiple interfaces (CLI, Python API, Docker) for flexible deployment, indicating a strong focus on development and version control workflows.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label is \"Development Tools\" because the server's core functionality revolves around accessing version control data, which is essential for developers working with the Chromium repository. The secondary label \"Version Control\" was added to emphasize this specific aspect, though it's not part of the predefined categories. Since \"Version Control\" is a common term in development, a custom label wasn't necessary to fully describe the functionality.",
