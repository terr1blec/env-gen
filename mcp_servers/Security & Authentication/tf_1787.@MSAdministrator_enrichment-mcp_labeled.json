    "analysis": "The Enrichment MCP Server is designed to perform security data enrichment by querying multiple third-party threat intelligence services. It primarily processes observables like IPs, domains, URLs, and emails to gather comprehensive threat intelligence. The server leverages services such as VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, and Shodan, making it a powerful tool for cybersecurity professionals and organizations needing enrichment capabilities. Its extensible architecture allows for easy integration of additional services and observable types, indicating adaptability to evolving cybersecurity needs.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Security & Authentication\" is chosen because the server's core function revolves around gathering threat intelligence, which is a critical aspect of security operations. The secondary label \"API Integration\" is included because the server interacts with multiple third-party APIs to fetch enriched data. The custom label \"Threat Intelligence Enrichment\" is added to specifically describe the unique functionality of aggregating and processing threat data from various sources.",
