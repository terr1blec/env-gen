    "analysis": "The VirusTotal MCP Server provides a suite of tools designed for cybersecurity analysis, threat intelligence, and relationship mapping. It allows users to query the VirusTotal API to retrieve comprehensive reports on files, URLs, domains, and IP addresses. The tools provide detailed security scan results, reputation data, behavior summaries, and relationship mappings between malware, threat actors, and network connections. This server enhances threat intelligence capabilities by offering advanced search functionalities and detailed relationship analysis.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label is \"Security & Authentication\" because the server's core functionality revolves around cybersecurity analysis and threat intelligence, which aligns with security tools. The secondary label \"Data Analysis & Processing\" is included because it provides detailed relationship mapping and advanced search capabilities, which are analytical in nature. The secondary label \"API Integration\" is also relevant due to its reliance on the VirusTotal API for data retrieval.",
