    "analysis": "The PentestThinkingMCP server is a specialized AI-driven tool for penetration testing and cybersecurity research. Its core functionality involves automating and optimizing multi-stage attack paths using advanced AI reasoning techniques like Beam Search and Monte Carlo Tree Search. It assists penetration testers, red teamers, and ethical hackers by providing intelligent attack recommendations, tool suggestions, and critical path analysis to maximize exploitation efficiency while minimizing noise. This goes beyond traditional one-off exploits, focusing on strategic, adaptive attack planning.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Security & Authentication\" is chosen because the server's core purpose revolves around penetration testing and attack simulation, which are fundamental to cybersecurity and ethical hacking. The secondary label \"Development Tools\" is included due to its potential use by security researchers and developers in testing and hardening systems. The custom label \"AI-Powered Offensive Security\" highlights the unique combination of AI and offensive security techniques offered by this tool.",
