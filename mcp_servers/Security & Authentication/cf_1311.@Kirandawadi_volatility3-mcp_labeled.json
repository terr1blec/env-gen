    "analysis": "The Volatility3 MCP Server focuses on memory forensics through automated and user-friendly analysis of memory dumps. Its core functionality revolves around identifying malware, investigating system processes, network connections, and system resources using Volatility3 plugins. The server simplifies memory analysis by providing natural language interactions and automated workflows, making it accessible to users without specialized knowledge. Key use cases include detecting OS types, listing/running Volatility3 plugins, analyzing processes and network connections, investigating process handles, and scanning for malware signatures using YARA rules. The tools provided enable forensic investigations, threat detection, and malware analysis in a structured and automated manner.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Security & Authentication\" is chosen because the server's primary use is detecting malware and analyzing memory dumps for forensic investigation, which fits well within security analysis and threat detection. The secondary labels \"Memory Management\" and \"Operating System\" are selected because the server heavily involves memory analysis and operating system detection as foundational steps for further investigation. No custom label is needed as the predefined categories adequately describe the server's functionality.",
