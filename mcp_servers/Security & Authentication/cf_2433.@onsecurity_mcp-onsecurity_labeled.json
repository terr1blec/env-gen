    "analysis": "The MCP Server described is focused on enabling interaction with the OnSecurity API to retrieve and analyze security assessment data. Its core functionality revolves around querying pentest rounds, findings, and notifications, then presenting this data in an easier-to-understand format. This facilitates streamlined security review processes by automating data retrieval and analysis through conversational queries.",
    "reasoning": "The primary functionality aligns strongly with Security & Authentication due to its focus on security assessment data and notifications. Additionally, it involves Data Analysis & Processing since it processes raw data into understandable summaries. The tools provided suggest that is primarily used for security-related information retrieval and presentation, hence the primary label.",
