    "analysis": "The MCP Server \"Pushinator\" is primarily designed to facilitate real-time push notifications for applications, enhancing user engagement through timely updates and alerts. The available tool, \"send-notification,\" suggests its core functionality revolves around sending notifications via a robust API, allowing seamless integration into various applications. The server addresses the need for efficient notification management, which is crucial for user engagement and communication in modern applications.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Communication Tools\" was chosen because the server's core functionality is centered around delivering messages (notifications) to users, which is a fundamental aspect of communication. The secondary label \"API Integration\" is relevant due to the mention of a robust API for seamless integration. A custom label \"Notification Management\" was added to specifically highlight the unique focus on push notifications, as this is not directly covered by the predefined categories.",
