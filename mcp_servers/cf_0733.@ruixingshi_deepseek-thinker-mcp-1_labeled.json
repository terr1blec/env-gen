    "analysis": "The MCP Server \"Deepseek Thinker\" is designed to leverage Deepseek's reasoning capabilities to enhance AI interactions. It provides structured outputs from Deepseek's thought processes, which can enrich conversational experiences. The server appears to be a specialized tool for improving AI dialog systems by integrating deeper reasoning layers.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"AI/ML Tools\" was chosen because the server is directly related to Deepseek's reasoning capabilities, which falls under AI/ML functionality. The secondary label \"Communication Tools\" is appropriate because it enhances conversational interactions, and \"Development Tools\" is relevant due to its integration with AI clients. No custom label is needed as the server's functionality is well-covered by the predefined categories.",
