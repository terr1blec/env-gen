    "analysis": "The MCP Server described is an IP Geolocation Server that provides tools to retrieve detailed information about an IP address, including user location and network details. This server allows applications to enhance their capabilities by integrating with the IPInfo API, thereby enabling functionalities such as geolocation tracking, network diagnostics, and user-based personalization.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Web Search & Research\" is chosen because the server's core functionality involves retrieving detailed information about IP addresses, which is a common use case in web research, network analysis, and user tracking. The secondary label \"API Integration\" is considered relevant because the server relies on integrating with the IPInfo API to provide its services. The \"Network Operations\" custom label is added to specifically describe the server's focus on IP address analysis and network-related details, which isn't covered by the predefined categories.",
