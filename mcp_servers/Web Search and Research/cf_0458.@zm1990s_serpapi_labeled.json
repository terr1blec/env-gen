    "analysis": "The MCP SerpApi Search Server is primarily designed to execute fast and parsed search queries across major search engines (Google, Bing, YouTube) and retrieve live or archived results. It integrates directly with user applications, providing access to search data and location resources. This indicates its core functionality revolves around web-based search and information retrieval without the need for manual browsing. The server likely automates and streamlines the process of acquiring structured search results programmatically.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label is chosen because the server's main function aligns with performing web searches and gathering information from search engines. Browser Automation is a secondary label as it involves interacting with and extracting data from web platforms automatically. API Integration is included due to the server's role in providing structured search results through an API-like interface to applications. There is no unique functionality that cannot be covered by predefined labels.",
