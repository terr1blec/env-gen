    "analysis": "The MCP Server \"Deep Research\" is primarily focused on facilitating comprehensive web research by automating the process of gathering, structuring, and converting data from multiple sources into well-organized markdown documents. It enhances research workflows by aggregating data more efficiently and is particularly useful for creating high-quality content with large language models. The core functionality revolves around web crawling, data extraction, and structuring.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Web Search & Research\" is chosen because the server's main purpose is to facilitate efficient web research and data gathering. The secondary label \"Browser Automation\" is selected as the tool likely involves automated web crawling and data extraction. There is no need for a custom label as the functionality is well covered by the predefined categories.",
