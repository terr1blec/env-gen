    "analysis": "The MCP Server for Recraft AI focuses on advanced image generation, manipulation, and enhancement. Its tools enable users to create and edit high-quality raster and vector images, including features like style creation, vectorization, background removal/replacement, and upscaling. The server's capabilities are centered around creative workflows and image processing, primarily serving digital artists, designers, and content creators.",
    "reasoning": "The primary category is **Content Creation** since the server's main purpose is generating, editing, and enhancing images. The inclusion of **AI/ML Tools** is justified because all functionalities leverage AI-powered operations like image generation and style transfer. No custom label is needed as the predefined categories sufficiently cover the server's features.",
