    "analysis": "The MCP Server is designed primarily for web scraping, data extraction, and browser automation. It provides tools for crawling websites, extracting structured data, and performing automated interactions with web pages using different automation agents optimized for speed, complexity, or flexibility. Additional tools include managing Hyperbrowser profiles for persistence and performing web searches via Bing. The server excels in tasks requiring detailed, explicit instructions for web interactions, structured data retrieval, and systematic data collection from web sources.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Browser Automation\" is chosen because the server's core functionality revolves around automated interactions with web pages, including scraping, crawling, and structured data extraction. The secondary labels \"Web Search & Research\" and \"Data Analysis & Processing\" are included because the server supports web searches (via Bing) and facilitates data collection/extraction that can be used for analysis. No custom label is needed as the predefined categories adequately cover the server's functionality.",
