    "analysis": "The Asset Price MCP Server is designed to retrieve and display real-time asset price information for various assets, including precious metals and cryptocurrencies. Its core functionality revolves around providing up-to-date financial data, which can be integrated into applications or used by large language models. The sole available tool, \"get_asset_price,\" indicates that the server's primary purpose is to fetch current market prices efficiently.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label of \"Financial Services\" was chosen as it directly aligns with the server's purpose of providing real-time asset pricing data. The secondary label of \"Cryptocurrency & Blockchain\" is included because the server explicitly mentions cryptocurrencies as part of its supported asset types. The server doesn't appear to have unique functionality that warrants a custom label, as its purpose is well-covered by predefined categories.",
