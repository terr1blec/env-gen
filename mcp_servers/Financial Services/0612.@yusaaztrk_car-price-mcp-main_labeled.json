    "analysis": "The MCP Server focuses on providing real-time Brazilian vehicle price information by leveraging the official FIPE API. Its core functionality includes retrieving car brands, searching for models and prices by brand, and categorizing vehicles by type (cars, motorcycles, trucks). The tools enable users to access comprehensive vehicle details such as production years, fuel types, and current market prices, facilitating informed decisions on vehicle pricing.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Financial Services\" is chosen because the server deals with market pricing and financial data about vehicles, which aligns with the category's focus on financial information. The secondary label \"E-commerce\" is relevant due to the price comparison and vehicle information needs that are common in the e-commerce space, particularly for automotive sales or rentals. No custom label is needed as the predefined categories adequately cover the server's functionality.",
