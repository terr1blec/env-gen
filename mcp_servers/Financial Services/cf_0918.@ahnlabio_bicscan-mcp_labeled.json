    "analysis": "BICScan is a blockchain intelligence tool that provides risk assessment and asset tracking for cryptocurrency addresses and decentralized applications (dApps). Its core functionality includes real-time scanning of blockchain addresses to determine risk scores and asset holdings. This makes it particularly useful for financial security, compliance, and informed decision-making in the blockchain space. The available tools include getting risk scores and retrieving asset holdings by various address types (EOA, CA, ENS, CNS, KNS), indicating its utility in monitoring and assessing blockchain assets securely.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label is selected based on the server's focus on risk assessment and financial security in the cryptocurrency and blockchain domain. Secondary labels are chosen to represent its capability to manage and analyze blockchain assets, as well as integrate with financial services through its API. The predefined categories best capture the server's functionality without needing custom labels.",
