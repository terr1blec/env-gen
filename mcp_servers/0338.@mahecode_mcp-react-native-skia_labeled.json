    "analysis": "The MCP Server is focused on solving animation challenges specifically for React Native Skia by providing a structured thinking tool. It helps developers break down complex animation problems, plan performant animations, and optimize visualization effects. The tool is designed to guide through the animation workflow with performance considerations, branching approaches, and iterative refinement. It also provides code snippets and performance insights tailored to mobile animation constraints.",
    "reasoning": "The primary functionality aligns with \"Development Tools\" as it is specialized for developers working with React Native Skia, offering systematic problem-solving for animation development. A secondary label of \"Browser Automation\" could be considered due to its structured thinking and branching approach, though it's primarily developer-focused. The tool's emphasis on animation optimization and code snippets makes it most applicable to development workflows.",
