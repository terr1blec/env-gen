    "analysis": "The MCP Server focuses on aggregating and delivering up-to-date news and articles, particularly in the cryptocurrency domain. Its primary functionality involves web scraping, data aggregation, and dynamic content retrieval to keep users informed about the latest events and deep analyses in the crypto space. This aligns well with news aggregation and financial services, specifically cryptocurrency-related content.",
    "reasoning": "The server's core functionality of aggregating news feeds and providing articles is best represented by the \"News & Media\" category. Given the focus on cryptocurrency, the \"Cryptocurrency & Blockchain\" category is also relevant.
