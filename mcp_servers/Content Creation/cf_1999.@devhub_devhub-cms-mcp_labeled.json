    "analysis": "The MCP Server primarily functions as a content management system (CMS) integration for the DevHub platform. It allows users to manage blog posts, media content, and location information (e.g., hours of operation) through a set of API-like tools. The tools enable creating, updating, and retrieving blog posts, uploading images, and managing location details. This aligns closely with content management and media handling, but also touches on file management for images and operational data handling for business hours.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Content Management\" is chosen because the server's core functionality revolves around creating, updating, and retrieving content (blog posts and media). The secondary labels \"File Management\" and \"Daily Productivity\" are selected because the server handles file uploads (images) and operational data (hours of operation), which support organizational and productivity tasks. No custom label is needed as the server's functionality is well-covered by the predefined categories.",
