    "analysis": "The MCP Server is primarily focused on enabling email sending functionality for LLM applications, making it easier to integrate email capabilities without manual processes. It leverages Resend's API to provide seamless email composition and dispatch. The available tools indicate some level of server management, suggesting basic authentication and access control features. The core use case is automation of email tasks within applications, improving productivity by eliminating manual copying and pasting.",
    "reasoning": "The primary functionality is clearly centered around email communication, making the Email category most appropriate. While Communication Tools could also apply, Email is more specific. The server management aspect with authentication suggests Security & Authentication as an additional relevant category. Neither predefined nor custom labels are needed to uniquely describe the server's functionality beyond these primary aspects.",
