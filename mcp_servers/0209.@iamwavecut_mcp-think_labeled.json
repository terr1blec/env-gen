    "analysis": "The MCP Server is designed to capture and manage the reasoning and thought processes of an LLM or user. It provides tools to record, retrieve, analyze, and clear thoughts during a session, making it useful for structured decision-making, complex problem-solving, and maintaining a organized thought history. The primary focus is on cognitive process management and augmentation.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Memory Management\" was chosen because the server's core functionality revolves around storing, retrieving, and analyzing thoughts (a form of cognitive data). Secondary labels \"Daily Productivity\" and \"AI/ML Tools\" were selected because the server aids in productivity through better thought organization and enhances AI capabilities by capturing reasoning processes. No custom label is needed as the predefined categories adequately describe the server's functionality.",
