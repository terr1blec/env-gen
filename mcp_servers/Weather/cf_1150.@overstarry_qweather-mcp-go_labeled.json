    "analysis": "The MCP Server is primarily focused on providing comprehensive weather-related data through various APIs. It offers real-time weather conditions, forecasts (hourly, daily, minutely), air quality data, life indices, and weather warnings. The server acts as an integration tool for QWeather services, enabling seamless access to weather information for AI assistants and applications via standardized interfaces (stdio or SSE transports). The tools provided cover a wide range of weather and environmental data needs, making it highly useful for applications requiring precise weather information.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Weather\" is chosen because the server's core functionality revolves around providing weather-related data, which aligns perfectly with the predefined \"Weather\" category. Secondary labels \"API Integration\" and \"Data Analysis & Processing\" are selected because the server primarily functions as an API gateway for weather data and can be used for processing and analyzing weather information. Custom labels are unnecessary as the predefined categories adequately cover the server's functionality.",
