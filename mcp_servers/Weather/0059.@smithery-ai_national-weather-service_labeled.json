    "analysis": "The MCP Server is designed to provide comprehensive weather information for locations across the United States. It leverages government-sourced data to offer real-time weather conditions, detailed forecasts (both daily and hourly), weather alerts, and information about nearby weather stations. The tools are optimized for natural language queries, making weather data accessible without requiring API keys or technical expertise. The server primarily serves users who need reliable weather information for personal, travel, or emergency planning purposes.",
    "reasoning": "The \"Weather\" predefined category is the most relevant as it directly aligns with the server's core functionality of providing weather-related data. Since the server focuses specifically on US weather and does not fit into broader categories like \"Travel & Maps\" or \"News & Media\" as its primary purpose, no secondary labels are needed. The custom label emphasizes the server's unique focus on authoritative US weather data.",
