    "analysis": "The MCP Server serves as an integration layer between language models (LLMs) and external data/functional tools. Its core functionality is enabling dynamic interactions with real-world resources, allowing LLMs to execute actions and retrieve data from various sources in a standardized and secure manner. The provided tool \"get_bmi\" demonstrates this capability by performing a simple calculation based on user input, suggesting that the server can handle data processing and potentially more complex interactions with external systems.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"API Integration\" was chosen because the server's primary purpose is to bridge LLMs with external data sources and functionalities through standardized interfaces. The secondary label \"Data Analysis & Processing\" was selected due to the included tool that performs calculations (BMI), indicating some data processing capability. No custom label is needed as the predefined categories cover the server's functionality well.",
