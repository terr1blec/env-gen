    "analysis": "The ScrAPI MCP Server is primarily designed for web scraping, allowing users to extract data from websites that may have bot detection, geolocation restrictions, or captchas. Its core functionality revolves around retrieving HTML or Markdown content from web pages, enabling users to scrape content with ease even from challenging websites. The server solves problems related to data collection, web research, and browser automation by providing tools that bypass common obstacles to scraping.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label is chosen based on the server's core functionality of scraping web pages, which aligns with \"Browser Automation\" due to its web interaction capabilities. \"Web Search & Research\" is a secondary label as it supports data collection and research activities. No custom label is needed as the predefined labels adequately cover the server's functionality.",
