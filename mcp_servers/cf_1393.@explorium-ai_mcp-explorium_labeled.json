    "analysis": "The MCP Server specializes in business intelligence and prospect enrichment through the Explorium API. Its primary functionality revolves around fetching, matching, and enriching business-related data, such as firmographics, technographics, financial metrics, workforce trends, and competitive insights. It also provides tools for prospect management, including contact enrichment and LinkedIn post analysis. The server is designed for applications requiring detailed business profiles, competitive analysis, and prospect research.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Business Intelligence\" was chosen because the server's core functionality aligns with collecting, analyzing, and providing actionable business-related data. \"Data Analysis & Processing\" is a secondary label due to the server's tools for processing business data and metrics. While \"Database Operations\" could fit, the Tools are more specialized in query-enriched data rather than direct database management. No custom label is needed as predefined categories sufficiently cover the functionality.",
