    "analysis": "The Azure CLI MCP Server is a specialized server that wraps around Microsoft Azure's Command Line Interface (CLI), allowing users to manage Azure cloud resources through natural language interactions powered by an LLM. Its core functionality is to enable the execution of Azure CLI commands in a user-friendly manner, facilitating tasks such as resource management (create, update, delete), security configuration, and other operations typically performed via the Azure CLI.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Cloud Services\" is chosen because the server's core purpose is to manage and interact with Azure cloud services via CLI commands. Azure CLI is inherently tied to cloud platform operations, making this the most accurate predefined category. While it could also involve aspects of system operations or automation, the primary focus is on cloud resource management.",
