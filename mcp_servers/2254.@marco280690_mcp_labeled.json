    "analysis": "The MCP Server functions as an integration hub that combines language model capabilities with real-world data access (files, databases, APIs) to enhance workflow automation and complex problem-solving. Its primary tool, \"sequentialthinking,\" specializes in structured, iterative analysis through a chain-of-thought approach, making it ideal for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, adaptive problem-solving, and maintaining contextual awareness. The server excels in scenarios where solutions evolve through refinement, hypotheses require verification, and uncertainty needs explicit handling.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Artificial Intelligence & Problem Solving\" was chosen because the server's core functionality revolves around AI-powered, structured reasoning and iterative problem-solving. The secondary labels reflect its capabilities in data integration, automation, and adaptability to complex workflows. The custom label highlights the server's unique approach to dynamic, reflective thinking processes.",
