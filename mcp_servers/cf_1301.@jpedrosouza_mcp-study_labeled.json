    "analysis": "The MCP Study server appears to be a framework or protocol for integrating language models with real-world data and actions. Its core functionality involves connecting models to various tools and resources, enabling seamless interaction and automation. The available tool, \"city-locator,\" suggests it can provide location-based services or geospatial data retrieval, which may be part of a larger suite of integrated functionalities.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label **API Integration** was chosen because the server seems to focus on connecting language models to external tools and services, acting as an intermediary layer for real-world data and actions. The secondary label **Daily Productivity** was selected because tools like city-locator could be used in productivity scenarios, such as location-based task management. No custom label is needed as the predefined categories adequately cover the server's functionality.",
