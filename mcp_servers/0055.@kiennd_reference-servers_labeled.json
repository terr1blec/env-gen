    "analysis": "The MCP Server \"Sequential Thinking\" is designed to facilitate structured, dynamic problem-solving through a process of iterative reasoning. It breaks down complex problems into manageable steps, allowing for continuous revision, branching, and verification of hypotheses. The core functionality involves generating and refining solution hypotheses based on a chain of interconnected thoughts, making it particularly useful for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, planning, or adaptive analysis. Its tools are optimized for flexibility, allowing users to adjust their approach as understanding evolves.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Problem-Solving & Reasoning\" is chosen because the server's core functionality revolves around structured, adaptive problem-solving and hypothesis verification. \"Decision Making\" is a secondary label due to its focus on revisiting and refining decisions dynamically. \"Research & Analysis\" is also relevant as the tool supports in-depth exploration and filtering of relevant information. A custom label \"Iterative Reasoning\" is added to highlight the server's unique capability for continuously refining thoughts and hypotheses.",
