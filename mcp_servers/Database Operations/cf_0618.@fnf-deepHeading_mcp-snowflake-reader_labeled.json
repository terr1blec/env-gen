    "analysis": "The Snowflake Reader MCP Server is designed to provide secure, read-only access to Snowflake databases. Its primary function is to facilitate data retrieval for analytics and reporting purposes without the risk of data modification. The single available tool \"query\" suggests that the server specializes in executing database queries, making it particularly useful for data analysis tasks where query integrity and performance are critical.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Database Operations\" was chosen because the server's core functionality revolves around interacting with database systems, specifically Snowflake databases, for data retrieval purposes. The secondary label \"Data Analysis & Processing\" was selected because the server is ideal for analytics and reporting tasks, which are core to data processing activities. No custom label is needed as the predefined categories adequately cover the server's functionality.",
