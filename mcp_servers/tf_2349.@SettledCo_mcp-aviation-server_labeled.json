    "analysis": "The MCP Server described focuses on providing access to aviation-specific data and tools through a standardized protocol. Its primary functionality revolves around querying and retrieving aviation-related information, particularly flight delays and compensation eligibility. The available tools specifically target real-time checks for flight delay compensation under different regulatory frameworks (e.g., AviationStack API, Canadian APPR regulations). This suggests the server is designed to enhance aviation workflows by integrating real-time and static aviation data into AI-driven environments.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Aviation Services\" is assigned because the server's core functionality is centered around aviation-specific tools and data, which isn't fully covered by any of the predefined categories. The secondary label \"API Integration\" is relevant because the server uses external APIs (like AviationStack) to provide its services. The \"Travel & Maps\" category is also applicable due to the server's focus on flight-related data. No custom label is needed as the predefined categories adequately represent its functionality.",
