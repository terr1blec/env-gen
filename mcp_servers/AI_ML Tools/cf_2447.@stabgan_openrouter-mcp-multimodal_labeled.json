    "analysis": "The MCP Server described is focused on enabling advanced multimodal interactions, combining chat capabilities with image analysis to enhance applications. It allows users to engage in conversations that include images, analyze images with custom queries, and optimize workflows with smart model selection. The available tool, \"Optional Settings,\" suggests some level of server management or access configuration for users who sign in. This indicates a strong focus on AI-powered interaction and potentially some level of system integration or user management.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"AI/ML Tools\" was chosen because the server's core functionality revolves around advanced AI capabilities for chat and image analysis, which are central to machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. The secondary label \"Content Creation\" was selected as the image analysis and multimodal interaction tools can support content creation or editing tasks. The server's ability to handle multimodal queries and optimize workflows also hints at potential use cases in \"Data Analysis & Processing,\" though this is less central than the AI/ML focus.",
