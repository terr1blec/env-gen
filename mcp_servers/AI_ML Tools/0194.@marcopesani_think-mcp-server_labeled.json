    "analysis": "The MCP Server is primarily designed to enhance AI reasoning capabilities by allowing the AI to pause and reflect on complex tasks. The 'think' tool enables structured thinking without altering external data, making it useful for multi-step problem-solving and policy adherence. This server improves decision-making consistency by providing a mechanism for structured reflection and cache memory simulation during interactions.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label 'AI/ML Tools' was chosen because the server's core functionality revolves around enhancing AI reasoning and decision-making processes, which are central to machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. The secondary label 'Memory Management' was added because the 'think' tool facilitates a form of artificial memory or reflection. The custom label 'Structured Reasoning' was created to highlight the server's unique focus on methodical thought processes during AI interactions.",
