    "analysis": "The MCP Server \"Whale Tracker\" is designed to monitor and analyze large cryptocurrency transactions in real-time. It primarily interfaces with the Whale Alert API to provide users with insights into whale activity, including recent transactions and detailed information about specific transactions by ID. The core functionality revolves around tracking and analyzing cryptocurrency transactions, particularly those involving significant amounts of cryptocurrency (whale transactions).",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Cryptocurrency & Blockchain\" was chosen because the server's primary functionality is tracking and analyzing large cryptocurrency transactions, which directly relates to blockchain activity and cryptocurrency monitoring. The secondary label \"Data Analysis & Processing\" was selected because the server provides tools to analyze transaction data, which involves data processing and potentially analytics. The custom label \"Whale Activity Monitoring\" was chosen to reflect the server's specific focus on tracking large cryptocurrency transactions, as this is a unique aspect not fully covered by the predefined labels.",
