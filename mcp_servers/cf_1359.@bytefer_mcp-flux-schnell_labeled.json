    "analysis": "The MCP Server \"Flux Schnell Image Generator\" primarily focuses on generating visual images from textual descriptions using the Flux Schnell model. This functionality is ideal for converting ideas into art and could be integrated into various applications for developers. The server's core problem-solving capability revolves around simplifying the process of image generation without requiring complex design skills, thereby catering to both artistic and development needs.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Content Creation\" was chosen as the server's tool is designed to create visual content from text. While AI/ML could also be a candidate, Content Creation is more specifically aligned with the practical output of the server, which is generating images.\n\n    If additional labels are to be considered, \"AI/ML Tools\" and \"Development Tools\" could be included, as the server uses advanced AI models (Flux Schnell) and is aimed at developers for easy integration into their projects.\n\n    No custom label was deemed necessary as the predefined categories adequately cover the server's functionality.",
