    "analysis": "The MCP Server allows executing shell commands in a secure and controlled environment, enhancing AI models with command execution capabilities. It integrates security measures to prevent dangerous operations while enabling safe command execution. The primary functionality revolves around running shell commands, which falls under system-level operations.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Operating System\" was chosen because the server's core function is executing shell commands, which is a fundamental aspect of operating system operations. \"Security & Authentication\" is a secondary label because of the built-in security measures that control and restrict command execution. No custom label is needed as the predefined categories sufficiently describe the server's functionality.",
