    "analysis": "The MCP Server described is a Flight Search Service primarily focused on enabling users to search for flights (one-way and round-trip) with real-time data integration via SerpAPI. It emphasizes ease of use, logging for tracking purposes, and a modular structure for scalability. The available tool (\"Optional Settings\") suggests user authentication and basic server management. The core functionality revolves around travel-related searches and data retrieval.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label is \"Travel & Maps\" as the core functionality is centered around flight search and trip planning, which aligns with travel services. The secondary label \"Web Search & Research\" is included because the service relies on an API to fetch real-time flight data, which is a form of web-based research. A custom label is not necessary as the predefined categories cover the server's key features.",
