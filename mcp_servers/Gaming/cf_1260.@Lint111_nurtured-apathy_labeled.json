    "analysis": "The Nurtured Apathy MCP Server appears to be a unique puzzle-platformer game where player emotions translate into gameplay mechanics. It combines strategic power management with physics-based movement and an emotion stack system, requiring precise controls and creative problem-solving. The server's primary function is to provide an engaging gaming experience, with a secondary utility allowing users to manage server access through optional sign-in settings.",
    "reasoning": "The game's core focus is on interactive entertainment and strategic gameplay, making \"Gaming\" the most appropriate primary label. The platformer/puzzle nature of the game aligns well with this category. While there is a secondary tool for server access management, this does not significantly impact the overall categorization of the server's primary purpose.",
