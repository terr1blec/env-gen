    "analysis": "The MCP Server provides tools dedicated to fetching and utilizing Morningstar's financial data and editorial research. Its core functionality revolves around accessing up-to-date market data (e.g., market capitalization, ratings, earnings per share) and expert analysis on investing, portfolio strategies, and sustainable investing. The tools are designed to enhance applications with reliable financial data and research content, focusing on Morningstar's proprietary insights rather than real-time factual data like stock prices or fund ratings.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Financial Services\" was chosen because the server's core functionality centers on financial data and research, which is a key aspect of the financial services category. Secondary label \"Data Analysis & Processing\" was selected due to the tools' ability to fetch and analyze financial datapoints. \"E-commerce\" is assigned as another secondary label due to its broader relevance, though less direct than financial services. No custom label is needed as the predefined labels adequately cover the server's functionality.",
