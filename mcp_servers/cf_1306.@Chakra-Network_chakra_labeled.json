    "analysis": "The Chakra MCP Server is designed to simplify database interactions by allowing users to manage databases using natural language queries. It supports operations like creating, updating, and deleting tables, and enables real-time data insights through subscribed data shares. The available tools focus on executing queries on the database, with specific instructions to use lowercase text and the LIKE operator for comparisons. This emphasizes its core functionality in database operations and data management.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Database Operations\" is selected because the server's main functionality revolves around managing and querying databases. The secondary label \"Data Analysis & Processing\" is relevant because real-time insights and data shares suggest analytical capabilities. No custom label is needed as the predefined categories adequately cover the server's functionality.",
