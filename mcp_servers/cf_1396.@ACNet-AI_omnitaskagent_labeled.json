    "analysis": "The OmniTaskAgent is designed to manage and decompose complex tasks across different task management systems. It integrates with professional task managers and editors, aiming to enhance productivity through intelligent workflows, multi-model support, and automated task analysis. The primary function revolves around task management, but it also enables smooth integration between development environments and external task systems.",
    "reasoning": "The core functionality fits best under **Daily Productivity** due to its focus on task management. It could also be relevant for **Development Tools** because it integrates with editors and supports development workflows. The automation aspect aligns with **Process Automation**, but since that's not a predefined category, it's not used. The custom label is suggested to highlight the distributed nature of task management across systems.",
