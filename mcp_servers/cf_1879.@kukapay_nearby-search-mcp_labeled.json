    "analysis": "The MCP Server described is dedicated to helping users search for nearby places based on their current location. It leverages IP-based location detection and integrates with Google Places to find local businesses, services, or attractions. The primary use case is providing location-based search capabilities with a simple interface and customizable parameters. The available tool, 'search_nearby', indicates that the server offers a straightforward way to search for nearby locations programmatically.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label is chosen as 'Travel & Maps' because the server's core functionality revolves around location-based services and finding nearby places, which aligns with travel planning and navigation use cases. The secondary label of 'Web Search & Research' is appropriate as the server assists in finding specific places or services, similar to research. The custom label 'Location-Based Search' is added to emphasize the specific use case of this server, which is not adequately covered by predefined categories.",
