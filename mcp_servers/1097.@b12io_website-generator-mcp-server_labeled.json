    "analysis": "The MCP Server specializes in generating complete business websites using AI-driven tools. It automates website creation based on given business names and descriptions, providing a streamlined workflow for users to gather and publish their websites. The core functionality revolves around using AI to produce web content and structure, significantly enhancing productivity in web development tasks.",
    "reasoning": "The primary functionality of generating websites with AI clearly aligns with the \"Content Creation\" category, as it focuses on creating web content. The server also interacts with web development workflows, which could be seen under \"Development Tools,\" but its main strength lies in automated content generation rather than coding or debugging. No custom label is needed as the predefined categories adequately cover the server's functionality.",
