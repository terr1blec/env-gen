    "analysis": "The Azure Resource Graph Server is designed specifically for querying and analyzing Azure resources across multiple subscriptions. Its core functionality revolves around retrieving detailed information about Azure resources using Kusto Query Language (KQL) to perform complex searches, filters, and data analysis. This is particularly useful for infrastructure auditing, resource inventory, compliance checking, and understanding the state of Azure environments. The server integrates with development environments to enhance productivity, indicating it is geared toward users who manage or interact with Azure resources frequently.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Cloud Services\" was chosen because the server's core function is related to querying and managing Azure resources, which is inherently tied to cloud service management. \"Database Operations\" is a secondary label because the server uses a query language (KQL) to interact with resources, akin to querying a database. A custom label \"Azure Resource Management\" was added to specifically describe the server's unique focus on Azure resource querying and analysis, going beyond generic cloud services.",
