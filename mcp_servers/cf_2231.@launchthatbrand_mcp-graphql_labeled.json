    "analysis": "The MCP Server described specializes in GraphQL API integration, enabling LLMs to dynamically interact with GraphQL APIs through schema introspection and query execution. This functionality allows for seamless interaction with GraphQL-based applications, which is crucial for developers and systems that need to query and manipulate data from GraphQL endpoints. The server also provides optional settings for managing server access and configurations.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label is \"API Integration\" because this server is specifically designed to facilitate interactions with GraphQL APIs. This aligns directly with the predefined category meant for third-party service integrations. There are no secondary labels as the server's primary focus is narrowly on GraphGL API interaction without other significant features. No custom label is necessary as the predefined labels adequately describe the server's core functionality.",
