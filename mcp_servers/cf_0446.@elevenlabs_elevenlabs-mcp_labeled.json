    "analysis": "The ElevenLabs MCP Server primarily focuses on providing advanced audio processing capabilities, including text-to-speech, speech-to-text, voice cloning, and agent creation. Its core functionality revolves around transforming and manipulating audio data to enhance user interaction and create custom audio experiences. The server also offers tools for managing voice libraries, making outbound calls, and integrating with other services like Twilio. These features make it particularly useful for applications requiring rich audio interaction, such as virtual assistants, call centers, and multimedia content creation.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Audio Processing\" was chosen because the server's main functionality centers around converting, cloning, and manipulating audio data. The secondary labels \"AI/ML Tools\" and \"Communication Tools\" were selected because the server leverages machine learning for voice cloning and agent creation, and it includes capabilities for making outbound calls and handling audio communication. The custom label \"Voice AI\" was added to highlight the server's advanced AI-driven voice-related features, which are not fully captured by the predefined categories.",
