    "analysis": "The MCP Server \"TripAdvisor Vacation Planner\" is designed to assist users in planning vacations by leveraging TripAdvisor data. It allows users to search for attractions, restaurants, hotels, and other locations based on various criteria, retrieve detailed information, and get nearby options. The tools provided are focused on location search, retrieval of specific details, and initiating the planning process for trips. This aligns with functionalities typically associated with travel planning, location services, and trip organization.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Travel & Maps\" is chosen because the server's core functionality revolves around location services, travel planning, and navigation, which are central to its purpose. The secondary label \"Web Search & Research\" is included because the server facilitates searching and retrieving detailed information about locations. The secondary label \"Daily Productivity\" is added because it assists in organizing and planning vacations, which falls under personal organization and productivity.",
