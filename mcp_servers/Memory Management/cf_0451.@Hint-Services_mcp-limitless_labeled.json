    "analysis": "The MCP Server provides tools to access, search, and analyze personal lifelog data recorded by Limitless AI, which captures daily conversations and activities. The primary functionality revolves around retrieving and querying personal data stored in the lifelog system. This enables users to enhance productivity, decision-making, and content creation by leveraging AI-assisted insights from their recorded activities. The tools focus on personal data management and interaction, with a strong emphasis on retrieval and search capabilities.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Memory Management\" is chosen because the server's core functionality revolves around storing, retrieving, and analyzing personal lifelog data, similar to a knowledge base or note-taking system. \"Content Creation\" is added as a secondary label because the insights derived from the lifelog can aid in generating content. The predefined categories adequately cover the server's functionality, so no custom label is needed.",
