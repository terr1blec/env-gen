    "analysis": "The MCP Server focuses on providing real-time cryptocurrency price data and market analysis, leveraging the CoinCap API (V3) to deliver comprehensive insights into market trends and dynamics. Its core functionality revolves around fetching, analyzing, and presenting cryptocurrency market data, which is a key requirement for crypto traders, investors, and analysts. The optional sign-in feature suggests some level of user management or personalization, but the primary use case is clearly market data analysis. The reliance on an external API (with authentication) indicates that this is fundamentally an API-driven data service.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Cryptocurrency & Blockchain\" captures the server's primary functionality of crypto market analysis. The secondary label \"API Integration\" acknowledges the heavy reliance on the CoinCap API (V3) for data retrieval. The server could also be considered under \"Data Analysis & Processing\" due to its analytical capabilities, but this is less central than its crypto-specific focus. No custom label is needed as the predefined categories sufficiently cover its functionality.",
