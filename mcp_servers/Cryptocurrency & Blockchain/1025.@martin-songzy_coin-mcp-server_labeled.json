    "analysis": "The MCP Server \"Coin Price Fetcher\" is designed to provide real-time cryptocurrency data, including current prices, token announcements, and detailed coin information. It primarily serves users who need quick and validated access to crypto market data, announcements, and blockchain-specific details about tokens. The server integrates with Bitget's API to fetch and validate this data reliably.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Cryptocurrency & Blockchain\" was chosen because the server's core functionality revolves around fetching and displaying crypto-related data. The secondary label \"Data Analysis & Processing\" was added because it involves querying structured token information and processing announcements. The \"Operating System\" label was included due to the tool's focus on blockchain chain operations and withdrawal/deposit mechanics. No custom label is needed as the predefined categories adequately cover the server's functionality.",
