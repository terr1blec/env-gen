    "analysis": "The StatPearls Medical Knowledge Server provides access to reliable, peer-reviewed medical information, formatted in a way that can be easily interpreted by AI systems. Its primary tool allows users to search and retrieve comprehensive data about diseases and conditions. This server serves as a knowledge base for medical information, enabling AI to enhance conversations with accurate and trusted medical knowledge seamlessly integrated via the Model Context Protocol.",
    "reasoning": "The primary functionality of this server is to provide medical knowledge, which aligns best with the Education category, as it is a source of accurate educational content for medical professionals or learners. The secondary label of Memory Management is appropriate because it acts as a repository of medical information. The server does not fit neatly into predefined categories beyond these, so no custom label is necessary.",
