    "analysis": "The MCP Server \"Lotus Wisdom\" is designed for structured, contemplative problem-solving using the principles of the Lotus Sutra. It facilitates a journey through different \"wisdom domains\" to break down complex problems by integrating analytical and intuitive insights. The process involves tracking the user's contemplative path, allowing for meditative pauses, and eventually synthesizing these insights into a coherent response. The tools provided are focused on guiding users through a reflective and wisdom-based approach to decision-making, rather than direct information retrieval or automation.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Contemplative Wisdom\" captures the server's unique focus on philosophical and intuitive problem-solving, distinguishing it from purely analytical or technical tools. Secondary labels \"Microsoft Edoc\" and \"Learning Support\" highlight its use as an educational and self-improvement tool, aiding in personal reflection and structured inquiry. \"Meditation & Mindfulness\" is a custom label reflecting the server's emphasis on meditative pauses and intuitive insight, which are central to its functionality.",
