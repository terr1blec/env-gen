This tool is designed for systematic refinement of thoughts and designs, particularly useful for complex problem-solving, logical analysis, and multi-step reasoning tasks. The available tool (chain-of-draft) provides parameters for critique, revision, and iterative improvement of reasoning chains, making it ideal for tasks requiring detailed analysis, error detection, and progressive refinement. It integrates with AI agents to enhance decision-making and implementation planning.",

Unlike traditional reasoning approaches, CoD mimics the human drafting process to improve clarity, accuracy, and robustness of conclusions.\n\n    ## When to Use This Tool:\n    - **Complex Problem-Solving:** Tasks requiring detailed, multi-step analysis with high accuracy demands\n    - **Critical Reasoning:** Problems where logical flow and consistency are essential\n    - **Error-Prone Scenarios:** Questions where initial reasoning might contain mistakes or oversight\n    - **Multi-Perspective Analysis:** Cases benefiting from examining a problem from different angles\n    - **Self-Correction Needs:** When validation and refinement of initial thoughts are crucial\n    - **Detailed Solutions:** Tasks requiring comprehensive explanations with supporting evidence\n    - **Mathematical or Logical Puzzles:** Problems with potential for calculation errors or logical gaps\n    - **Nuanced Analysis:** Situations with subtle distinctions that might be missed in a single pass\n\n    ## Key Capabilities:\n    - **Iterative Improvement:** Systematically refines reasoning through multiple drafts\n    - **Self-Critique:** Critically examines previous reasoning to identify flaws and opportunities\n    - **Focused Revision:** Targets specific aspects of reasoning in each iteration\n    - **Perspective Flexibility:** Can adopt different analytical viewpoints during critique\n    - **Progressive Refinement:** Builds toward optimal solutions through controlled iterations\n    - **Context Preservation:** Maintains understanding across multiple drafts and revisions\n    - **Adaptable Depth:** Adjusts the number of iterations based on problem complexity\n    - **Targeted Improvements:** Addresses specific weaknesses in each revision cycle\n\n    ## Parameters Explained:\n    - **reasoning_chain:** Array of strings representing your current reasoning steps. Each element should contain a clear, complete thought that contributes to the overall analysis.\n    \n    - **next_step_needed:** Boolean flag indicating whether additional critique or revision is required. Set to true until the final, refined reasoning chain is complete.\n    \n    - **draft_number:** Integer tracking the current iteration (starting from 1). Increments with each critique or revision.\n    \n    - **total_drafts:** Estimated number of drafts needed for completion. This can be adjusted as the solution evolves.\n    \n    - **is_critique:** Boolean indicating the current mode:\n      * true = Evaluating previous reasoning\n      * false = Implementing revisions\n    \n    - **critique_focus:** (Required when is_critique=true) Specific aspect being evaluated, such as:\n      * \"logical_consistency\": Checking for contradictions or flaws in reasoning\n      * \"factual_accuracy\": Verifying correctness of facts and calculations\n      * \"completeness\": Ensuring all relevant aspects are considered\n      * \"clarity\": Evaluating how understandable the reasoning is\n      * \"relevance\": Assessing if reasoning directly addresses the problem\n    \n    - **revision_instructions:** (Required when is_critique=false) Detailed guidance for improving the reasoning based on the preceding critique.\n    \n    - **step_to_review:** (Optional) Zero-based index of the specific reasoning step being critiqued or revised. When omitted, applies to the entire chain.\n    \n    - **is_final_draft:** (Optional) Boolean indicating whether this is the final iteration of reasoning.\n\n    ## Best Practice Workflow:\n    1. **Start with Initial Draft:** Begin with your first-pass reasoning and set a reasonable total_drafts (typically 3-5).\n    \n    2. **Alternate Critique and Revision:** Use is_critique=true to evaluate reasoning, then is_critique=false to implement improvements.\n    \n    3. **Focus Each Critique:** Choose a specific critique_focus for each evaluation cycle rather than attempting to address everything at once.\n    \n    4. **Provide Detailed Revision Guidance:** Include specific, actionable revision_instructions based on each critique.\n    \n    5. **Target Specific Steps When Needed:** Use step_to_review to focus on particular reasoning steps that need improvement.\n    \n    6. **Adjust Total Drafts As Needed:** Modify total_drafts based on problem complexity and progress.\n    \n    7. **Mark Completion Appropriately:** Set next_step_needed=false only when the reasoning chain is complete and satisfactory.\n    \n    8. **Aim for Progressive Improvement:** Each iteration should measurably improve the reasoning quality.\n\n    ## Example Application:\n    - **Initial Draft:** First-pass reasoning about a complex problem\n    - **Critique #1:** Focus on logical consistency and identify contradictions\n    - **Revision #1:** Address logical flaws found in the critique\n    - **Critique #2:** Focus on completeness and identify missing considerations\n    - **Revision #2:** Incorporate overlooked aspects and strengthen reasoning\n    - **Final Critique:** Holistic review of clarity and relevance\n    - **Final Revision:** Refine presentation and ensure direct addressing of the problem\n\n    Chain of Draft is particularly effective when complex reasoning must be broken down into clear steps, analyzed from multiple perspectives, and refined through systematic critique. By mimicking the human drafting process, it produces more robust and accurate reasoning than single-pass approaches.\n",
