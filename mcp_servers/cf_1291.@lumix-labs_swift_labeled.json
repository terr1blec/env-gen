    "analysis": "The MCP Server described focuses on modernizing legacy systems and reducing incidents through incremental deployment without complete rewrites. It emphasizes faster deployment cycles and zero-disruption implementation. The available tool, a UUID generator, suggests a development or system integration orientation. The core functionality centers around system modernization, incident reduction, and deployment acceleration.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Development Tools\" was chosen because the server's purpose aligns with software development and system modernization. Secondary labels \"Operating System\" and \"API Integration\" were selected due to the focus on deployment and system integration. No custom label is needed as the functionality fits well within the predefined categories.",
