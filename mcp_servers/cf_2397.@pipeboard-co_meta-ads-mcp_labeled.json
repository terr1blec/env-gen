    "analysis": "The MCP Server \"Meta Ads Integration Server\" is designed to facilitate AI model interactions with Meta advertising platforms (Facebook, Instagram). Its core functionality involves accessing, analyzing, and managing ad campaigns, providing actionable insights and strategic recommendations. This server acts as a bridge between AI models and advertising data, with a focus on performance visualization and optimization. The optional settings tool suggests user authentication and management capabilities.",
    "reasoning": "The primary functionality clearly falls under API integration, as it provides a standardized interface for AI models to interact with Meta's advertising systems. Data analysis is also relevant due to the server's role in analyzing ad performance. The secondary label \"Cryptocurrency & Blockchain\" was considered but discarded as it's not relevant here. \"Security & Authentication\" was also considered due to the login capability, but it's not the primary use case.",
