    "analysis": "The Exa AI Search Server primarily enables AI assistants to perform various types of web searches, including real-time searches, academic paper searches, and social media queries. It focuses on delivering optimized and relevant results while providing tools for comprehensive company research, competitor analysis, and content extraction from URLs. The server is designed to enhance AI-driven insights by tailoring search capabilities based on specific needs. The available tool, \"Optional Settings,\" suggests the ability to access and manage servers, indicating some level of configuration capability.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label is \"Web Search & Research\" because the core functionality revolves around performing searches (web, academic, social media) and gathering information. The secondary label \"Data Analysis & Processing\" is included because the server enhances insights and research through data extraction and analysis. \"Content Creation\" is another relevant label since the server helps in extracting and processing content from URLs. No custom label is needed as the predefined categories adequately cover the server's functionality.",
