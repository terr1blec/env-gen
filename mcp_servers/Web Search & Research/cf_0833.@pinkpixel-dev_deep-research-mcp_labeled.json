    "analysis": "The MCP Server is designed for comprehensive web research, leveraging AI-powered search and deep content crawling to gather extensive, up-to-date information. It aggregates and structures this data into detailed JSON outputs, which can be further processed to generate high-quality markdown documentation using LLMs. The server includes tools for customizing documentation prompts, output paths, and securely saving research results to specified file paths. The core functionality revolves around deep research, content aggregation, and documentation generation.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Web Search & Research\" was chosen because the server's core functionality is centered around performing deep web research using AI-powered tools, which aligns closely with this category. The secondary labels \"Data Analysis & Processing\" and \"File Management\" were selected because the server aggregates and structures research data into JSON outputs (data processing) and provides tools for saving research results to files (file management). The server's unique combination of deep research, AI-powered content aggregation, and documentation generation does not require a custom label, as the predefined categories sufficiently cover its functionality.",
