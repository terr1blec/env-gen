    "analysis": "The MCP Server specializes in integrating with Oracle NetSuite, a cloud-based business management suite. Its core functionality revolves around exposing NetSuite's data and operations through a standardized MCP interface, enabling AI applications to interact with NetSuite resources efficiently. The available tools mentioned (like Optional Settings for server access) suggest that this server acts as a middleware or bridge between AI workflows and NetSuite, simplifying automation, data retrieval, and other business operations typically managed within NetSuite.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"API Integration\" was chosen because the server's main purpose is to serve as an interface between AI applications and NetSuite, effectively acting as an integration layer via APIs. The secondary label \"Database Operations\" is relevant because NetSuite is essentially a database-driven ERP system, and the server facilitates interaction with its data structures. \"Operating System\" is included as a secondary label due to the mention of server access and management tools.",
