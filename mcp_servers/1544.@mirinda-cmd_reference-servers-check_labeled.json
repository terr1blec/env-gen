    "analysis": "The MCP Server described is focused on enhancing problem-solving capabilities through systematic and adaptive thinking. Its primary tool, sequentialthinking, enables dynamic analysis by allowing users to break down complex problems into sequential steps, revise or question previous thoughts, and explore alternative approaches. The tool is designed for iterative and reflective problem-solving, where users can adjust their thought process based on evolving understanding. This aligns closely with analytical and cognitive processing, particularly in scenarios requiring structured yet flexible thinking.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Data Analysis & Processing\" is chosen because the tool's core functionality is centered around analyzing and processing information in a structured, iterative manner. The secondary label \"Development Tools\" is included as the server is designed to be integrated into applications, making it relevant for developers. No predefined labels fully capture the nuanced nature of the thinking process, so a custom label \"Cognitive Problem Solving\" is used to accurately describe the unique Sequential Thinking approach.",
