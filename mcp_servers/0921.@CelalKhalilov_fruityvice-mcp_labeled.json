    "analysis": "The MCP Server described as \"Fruityvice Nutrition Info Server\" primarily acts as an interface to retrieve detailed nutrient information and taxonomy data for various fruits. It leverages the Fruityvice API to provide a structured dictionary containing nutritional facts (e.g., calories, fat, sugar, protein) as well as classification details (e.g., family, genus, order). Its core functionality is centered around providing dietary and biological information about fruits in a programmable manner. The available tool, `get_fruit_nutrition`, simplifies access to this data, making it useful for applications that require nutritional calculations, dietary planning, or botany-related integrations.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Educational\" was chosen because the server's main purpose is to provide detailed, structured nutritional and biological data about fruits, which is useful for educational purposes, dietary research, and health-related applications. The secondary label \"Health & Fitness\" is also fitting since the nutritional data can assist users in making informed dietary choices. No custom label was needed as the functionality aligns well with existing predefined categories.",
