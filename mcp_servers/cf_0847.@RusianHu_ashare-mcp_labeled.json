    "analysis": "The MCP Server described is focused on providing stock market data specifically for the A-share market (Chinese stocks). It offers real-time and historical data through an API, supporting various time intervals and stock code formats. The primary functionality revolves around querying stock prices, which aligns closely with financial services and stock market operations.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Financial Services\" was chosen because the server's core functionality is centered around providing stock market data, which is a key component of financial services. The secondary label \"API Integration\" was selected because the service is designed as an API for seamless integration, enabling other applications to access its data. The secondary label \"Financial Services\" was added because it more specifically targets critical parts of Financial Data and Analysis. No custom label is necessary as the predefined labels sufficiently cover the server's functionality.",
