    "analysis": "The MCP Server described is a Sequential Thinking Multi-Agent System designed to enhance problem-solving through collaborative, specialized agents. It processes and synthesizes thoughts dynamically, allowing for deeper analysis and exploration of ideas. The system appears to facilitate advanced cognitive operations by modeling sequential thought processes, making it ideal for complex decision-making, idea refinement, and nuanced problem-solving.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label is \"AI/ML Tools\" because the server's core functionality revolves around advanced computational and cognitive processes mediated by multiple agents, which aligns with AI and machine learning techniques. \"Development Tools\" could be a secondary label due to its potential use in debug workflows or decision support during development tasks. \"Data Analysis & Processing\" is also relevant as it aids in synthesizing and refining information.",
