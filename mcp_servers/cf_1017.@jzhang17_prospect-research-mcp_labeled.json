    "analysis": "The MCP Server is designed to assist with prospect research tasks by providing tools for web searches, web scraping, and batch keyword-based searches. It helps users gather detailed information from specific webpages, find exact keyword matches across multiple queries, and process information efficiently. The primary purpose is to streamline research workflows, particularly in academic, business, or investigative contexts where precise and volume-oriented data collection is essential.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Web Search & Research\" was chosen because the server's core functionality revolves around enabling efficient and systematic information gathering, which aligns with research tasks. \"Browser Automation\" was included as a secondary label due to its web scraping capabilities, and \"Data Analysis & Processing\" to acknowledge its batch search and exact keyword matching features. No custom label is needed as the predefined categories suffice.",
