    "analysis": "The MCP Server is primarily focused on game development, providing tools to design game mechanics, UI components, and implementation strategies. It emphasizes structured thinking in game design, with features for creating modern UIs, physics systems, shaders, and player experience goals. The available tools allow for code generation, Performance consideration, and export of game design documentation. The server caters to both design and technical aspects of game development, making it a comprehensive platform for game developers.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Development Tools\" was chosen because the server's core functionality revolves around game development, with features like code generation, system architecture design, and implementation strategies. The secondary label \"Content Creation\" was selected due to its emphasis on UI design and visual enhancements, while \"Gaming\" was chosen to highlight its specific focus on game development. No custom label is needed as the predefined categories adequately cover the server's functionality.",
