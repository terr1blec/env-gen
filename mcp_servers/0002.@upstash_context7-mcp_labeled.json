    "analysis": "The MCP Server is primarily designed to fetch up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples for libraries or packages. It resolves package/product names to library IDs and retrieves relevant documentation, ensuring users get accurate and current information. This solves the problem of outdated or hallucinated API documentation, making it particularly valuable for developers who need reliable coding references.",
    "reasoning": "The primary functionality aligns with documentation retrieval and code example provision, which is most closely related to development tools. The secondary labels of Web Search & Research and Browser Automation are relevant due to the server's ability to resolve queries and retrieve accurate, up-to-date information, similar to web search and automation tools. No custom label is needed as the predefined categories cover the server's functionality well.",
