    "analysis": "The MCP Server focuses on enabling seamless financial transaction processing, specifically integrating AI tools with Cashfree's payment-related APIs. It supports core financial operations including payment link creation, order management, refunds, transfers, and KYC verification, suggesting a specialization in financial workflow automation and secure transactions. The available tool \"Optional Settings\" indicates basic server management capabilities, but the primary emphasis is on financial and transactional services.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Financial Services\" was chosen because the server's core functionality revolves around payment processing, payouts, and KYC verification, which are key aspects of financial operations. The secondary label \"API Integration\" was selected as the server facilitates interaction with third-party financial APIs. No custom label is needed as the predefined labels sufficiently capture the server's functionality.",
