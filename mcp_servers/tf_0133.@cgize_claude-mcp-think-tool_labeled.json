    "analysis": "The MCP Server, \"Think Tool Server,\" is designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Claude, an AI assistant. Its core functionality revolves around structured thinking, where users can log, review, and analyze thoughts during complex problem-solving tasks. The server doesn't fetch new information but instead helps organize and optimize the reasoning process within a session. This is particularly useful for multi-step analyses, policy adherence scenarios, and sequential decision-making, ensuring better outcomes by maintaining a clear log of thoughts.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Memory Management\" is chosen because the server's primary function is to store, retrieve, and analyze thoughts, acting as a session-based \"memory\" or logging system. \"Daily Productivity\" is a secondary label as it aids in organized thinking and decision-making, improving personal efficiency. No custom label is needed as the predefined categories sufficiently cover the server's functionality.",
