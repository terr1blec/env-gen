    "analysis": "The MCP Server is primarily a Text-to-Speech (TTS) service that converts written text into natural-sounding speech, which can be played through the user's system. It allows users to integrate high-quality speech synthesis into their applications. The functionality is centered around enabling voice output, customizable via environment variables for tailored interactions. The main problem it solves is providing a simple, high-quality TTS solution that can be easily integrated into other applications or workflows.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"AI/ML Tools\" was chosen because the server leverages text-to-speech synthesis, which is a machine learning-powered technology. \"Browser Automation\" is included as a secondary label because, while not its primary function, TTS can be used in automated workflows where voice output is needed. No unique functionality outside the predefined categories is observed.",
