    "analysis": "The MCP Server for Microsoft 365 Bookings focuses on scheduling and appointment management through the Microsoft Graph API. Its tools allow users to interact with booking businesses, staff, services, and appointments, making it a powerful solution for managing scheduling workflows. The core functionality revolves around enhancing productivity and efficiency in scheduling-related tasks.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Daily Productivity\" was chosen because the server's main purpose is to enhance scheduling and appointment management, which are key aspects of personal and business productivity. \"Database Operations\" is included as a secondary label since the server interacts with Microsoft Graph API to store and retrieve booking data. No custom label is needed as the functionality is well-covered by existing categories.",
