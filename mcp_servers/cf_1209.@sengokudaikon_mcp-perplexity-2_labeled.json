    "analysis": "The MCP Server integrates with the Perplexity API, offering expert programming assistance and chat capabilities. This indicates it's primarily a tool for interacting with artificial intelligence, particularly for coding-related queries and conversational assistance. The available tool for server management suggests some administrative functionality, but this appears secondary to its AI-focused interaction capabilities.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label is chosen as \"AI/ML Tools\" since the server's core functionality involves interacting with Perplexity's AI for programming assistance. \"Chatbots & Conversational AI\" is selected as a custom label to better capture the specific chat-related aspect of its functionality. While \"Communication Tools\" could apply, it's less specific than the AI-focused labels.",
