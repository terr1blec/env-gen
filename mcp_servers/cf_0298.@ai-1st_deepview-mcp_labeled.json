    "analysis": "The MCP Server \"DeepView\" is designed to analyze large codebases efficiently by leveraging Gemini's extensive context window. It allows users to load and query entire codebases from a single file, making it easier to perform code analysis and search through large source files. The integration with IDEs like Cursor and Windsurf further enhances the coding experience by providing seamless access to code analysis tools within the development environment. This server solves the problem of managing and querying large codebases, which is crucial for software development, debugging, and code review.",
    "reasoning": "The primary functionality of DeepView revolves around code analysis and querying large codebases, which fits well into the \"Development Tools\" category. The integration with IDEs and the ability to enhance the coding experience also aligns with this category. No secondary labels are necessary as the primary label fully encompasses the server's core functionality. No custom label is needed as the predefined categories cover the server's features adequately.",
