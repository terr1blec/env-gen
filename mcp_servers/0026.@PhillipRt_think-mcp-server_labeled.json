    "analysis": "The MCP Server \"Think Tool Server\" is designed to enhance AI reasoning capabilities by providing a structured space for complex problem-solving. The primary tool, \"think,\" facilitates in-depth analysis and policy adherence without external data retrieval or database modification. It acts as a cognitive aids to improve response accuracy and reliability in tasks requiring detailed reasoning.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label \"Memory Management\" was chosen because the server functions as an append-only log system for thoughts, acting like cognitive scratch space. Although \"AI/ML Tools\" is relevant, the server's focus is more on structured reasoning rather than direct machine learning. No secondary labels are necessary as the custom label better captures the unique functionality. The custom label \"Cognitive Reasoning\" was created because the server's primary purpose is to facilitate logical analysis and complex decision-making, which isn't perfectly covered by existing categories.",
