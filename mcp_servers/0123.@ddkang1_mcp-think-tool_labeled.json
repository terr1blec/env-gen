    "analysis": "The MCP Server is designed to enhance reasoning and problem-solving by providing a structured environment for capturing and analyzing thoughts systematically. Its core functionality revolves around recording, reviewing, and managing thought processes during complex tasks. The server's tools focus on structuring reasoning, maintaining thought history, and allowing for a clean slate when needed, making it particularly useful for detailed analyses, decision-making, and workflows that require iterative refinement.",
    "reasoning": "The primary label is chosen because the server's functionality is centered around enhancing cognitive processes and structured reasoning, which aligns with tools that support in-depth analysis and memory management. The secondary labels are included because the server supports organizing information and provides a workspace for detailed reasoning, which can be helpful in academic or research contexts. No predefined category perfectly captures the unique aspect of structured thought management, hence the custom label is used.",
